# 🏃‍♂️ Alex's Journey Home - Game Story

## 📖 The Story

Meet **Alex**, a curious 10-year-old student who just learned about **Kinetic Energy** in science class! 

Every day after school, Alex wants to get home as quickly as possible. But here's the fun part - Alex discovered that by using the principles of Kinetic Energy, they can create exciting paths to zoom home faster!

## 🎯 Your Mission

**Help Alex get home from school using Kinetic Energy!**

You'll draw paths (ramps, slides, jumps) that Alex can use to travel. The steeper the path, the more speed Alex gains, and the faster they get home!

## 🌟 The Journey

### Chapter 1: First Day (Level 1)
Alex's first attempt at using physics to get home. Simple and straightforward!

### Chapter 2: The Fast Track (Level 2)
Alex discovers that different speeds create different amounts of energy. Collect energy stars along the way!

### Chapter 3: The Shortcut (Level 3)
There's a gap in the path! Alex needs enough speed (Kinetic Energy) to jump across!

### Chapter 4: Double Challenge (Level 4)
Two gaps to jump! Keep the momentum going!

### Chapter 5: The Big Loop (Level 5)
A loop-de-loop! Alex needs LOTS of energy to make it around!

### Chapter 6: Precision Path (Level 6)
Navigate through specific speed zones - not too fast, not too slow!

### Chapter 7: The Efficient Route (Level 7)
Find the smartest path with limited space!

### Chapter 8: Uphill Journey (Level 8)
Sometimes you need to go up before you go down!

### Chapter 9: Obstacle Course (Level 9)
The ultimate test - gaps, walls, and speed challenges!

### Chapter 10: Master Journey (Level 10)
Alex's final journey home - combining everything learned!

## 🎓 What Alex Learns

Along the way, Alex (and you!) will understand:

- **Kinetic Energy (KE)**: Energy of motion
- **The Formula**: KE = ½ × mass × speed²
- **Speed Matters**: Faster = More energy
- **Height Helps**: Starting higher = More speed
- **Energy Transform**: Potential energy becomes kinetic energy

## 💡 The Science

As Alex rolls down hills:
- **Potential Energy** (being high up) converts to **Kinetic Energy** (speed)
- Steeper slopes = Faster acceleration = More KE
- More KE = Can do more (jump gaps, complete loops)
- The colored glow shows Alex's energy level

### Energy Colors:
- 🩶 **Gray**: Just starting (no KE yet)
- 💙 **Blue**: Walking pace (low KE)
- 💚 **Green**: Running (medium KE)  
- 💛 **Gold**: Sprinting! (high KE)
- 🧡 **Orange**: Super speed! (ultra KE)

## 🏠 The Goal

Help Alex master the physics of motion and get home safely every day!

Each successful journey home means Alex better understands Kinetic Energy and can share this knowledge with friends!

## 👨‍🏫 Teacher's Note
